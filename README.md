## Cookie statement

Whenever you use our online services or apps, we use cookies and other online tracking technologies (which we’ll also refer to as “cookies” for the purpose of this Cookie Statement).
Cookies can be used in various ways, including to make the Eztrippers.it website work, analyze traffic, or for advertising purposes.

## How are cookies used?

Cookies are used to collect info, including:
IP address
- Device ID
- Viewed pages
- Browser type
- Browsing info
- Operating system
- Internet service provider
- Timestamp
- Whether you have responded to an advertisement
- A referral URL
- Features used or activities engaged in on the website/apps.
They allow you to be recognized as the same user across the pages of a website, devices, between websites, or when you use our apps. When it comes to purpose, they’re divided into three categories: Functional cookies, analytical cookies, and marketing cookies.
Functional cookies
These are cookies required for our websites and apps to function and must be enabled for you to use our services.
Functional cookies are used to create technologically advanced, user-friendly websites and apps that adapt automatically to your needs and preferences, so you can browse and book easily. This also includes enabling essential security and accessibility features.
More specifically, these cookies:
Enable our website and apps to work properly, so you can create an account, sign in, and manage your bookings.
Remember your selected currency and language settings, past searches, and other preferences to help you use our website and apps efficiently and effectively.
Remember your registration info so you don’t have to retype your log-in credentials each time you visit our website or app. (Don’t worry, passwords are always encrypted.)

## Analytical cookies

These cookies measure and track how our website and apps are used. We use this info to improve our website, apps, and services.
More specifically, these cookies:
- Help us understand how visitors and customers like you use Eztrippers.it and our apps.
- Help improve our website, apps, and communications to make sure we're interesting and relevant.
- Allow us to find out what does and doesn't work on our website and apps.
- Help us understand the effectiveness of advertisements and communications.
- Teach us how users interact with our website or apps after they’re shown an online ad, including ads on third-party websites.
- Enable our business partners to learn whether or not their customers make use of any accommodation offers integrated into their websites.
The data we gather through these cookies can include which web pages you’ve viewed, which referral/exit pages you’ve entered and left from, which platform type you’ve used, which emails you’ve opened and acted upon, and date and timestamp info. It also means we can use details about how you’ve interacted with the site or app, such as the number of clicks you make on a given screen, your mouse and scrolling activity, the search words you use, and the text you enter into various fields.
Marketing cookies
These cookies are used by Eztrippers.it and our trusted partners to gather info about you over time, across multiple websites, applications, or other platforms.
Marketing cookies help us to decide which products, services, and interest-based ads to show you, both on and off our website and apps.
More specifically, these cookies:
- Categorize you into a certain interest profile, for example, based on the websites you visit and your click behavior. We use these profiles to display personalized content (e.g. travel ideas or specific accommodations) on Eztrippers.it and other websites. 
- Display personalized and interest-based ads both on the Eztrippers.it website, our apps, and other websites. This is called “retargeting” and is based on your browsing activities, such as the destinations you’ve searched for, the accommodations you’ve viewed, and the prices you’ve been shown. It can also be based on your shopping habits or other online activities.
Retargeting ads can be shown to you both before and after you leave eztrippers.it since their aim is to encourage you to browse or return to our website. You might see these ads on websites, apps, or in emails.
- Integrate social media into our website and apps. This allows you to like or share content or products on social media such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Pinterest, Snapchat, and LinkedIn.
These “like” and “share” buttons work using pieces of code from the individual social media providers, allowing third-party cookies to be placed on your device.
These cookies can be purely functional, but can also be used to keep track of which websites you visit from their network, to build a profile of your online browsing behavior, and to show you personalized ads. This profile will be partly built using comparable info the providers receive from your visits to other websites in their network.
To read more about what social media providers do with your personal data, take a look at their cookie and/or privacy statements: Facebook (includes Instagram, Messenger, and Audience Network), Snapchat, Pinterest, and Twitter. Be aware that these statements may be updated from time to time.
We work with trusted third parties to collect data. We may occasionally share info with these third parties, such as your email address or phone number. These third parties might link your data to other info they collect to create custom audiences or deliver targeted ads. For info about how these third parties process your data, take a look at the following links: How Google uses information, Facebook's data policy.
Non-cookie techniques – email pixels
We may also use techniques like pixels, which we don’t mark as cookies because they don’t store any info on your device.
We sometimes place pixels in emails like newsletters. A “pixel” is an electronic file the size of a single pixel that’s placed in the email and loaded when you open it. By using email pixels, we can see if the message was delivered, if and when you read it, and what you click.
We also receive this info about the push notifications we send you. These statistics provide us with feedback about your reading behavior, which we use to optimize our messages, and make our communications more relevant to you.

If you choose to block certain functional cookies, you may not be able to use some features of our services.
In addition to specific settings that we may offer on the eztrippers.it and apps, you can also opt out of certain cookies:
Analytics To prevent Google Analytics from collecting analytical data on certain browser types visit the following link: Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on (only available on desktop). 
Advertising We always aim to work with advertising and marketing companies that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB). Members of the NAI and IAB adhere to industry standards and codes of conduct, and allow you to opt out of behavioral advertising. Visit www.networkadvertising.org to identify NAI members that may have placed advertising cookies on your computer. To opt out of any NAI member's behavioral advertising program, just check the box that corresponds to that company. You may also want to visit www.youronlinechoices.com or www.youradchoices.com to learn how to opt out of customized ads. Your mobile device may allow you to limit the sharing of info for retargeting purposes through its settings. If you choose to do so, remember that opting out of an online advertising network doesn't mean you’ll no longer see or be subject to online advertising or marketing analysis. It just means the network you opted out of won't deliver ads customized to your web preferences and browsing patterns anymore. 
Some websites have “Do Not Track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. We’re currently unable to support “Do Not Track” browser settings.
